# politicalnoise
Takes the given text file, plots out the frequency of politically left vs. right-leaning phrases through sentiment analysis, with dogwhistles at the furthest ends of extremity, then (just for fun) includes an option to match the map of left/right word frequencies to the closest color of noise. (because doesn't so much of political conversation we disagree with become just that...)

# "Capitalist" vs. "Free market", etc.
It's not necessarily the case that a person using the term "capitalist" instead of "free market" would identify as relatively left-leaning -- for one, context can determine the applicability of synonyms in place of their counterparts. It could additionally be interesting to see if it somehow patterned for context/environment, i.e. someone frequently in left-leaning spaces (Twitter) might uses phrases typical of a demographic they might not affiliate with, simply from exposure. But with these in view, the results are hence plotted as a graph of phrase frequency against political sentiment score. This best allows self-identifying phrases of greater extremity (strongest case of this: dogwhistles) to stand out from phrases absorbed from context.
