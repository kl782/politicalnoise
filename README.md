# politicalnoise
takes the given text file, plots out the frequency of politically left vs. right-leaning phrases through sentiment analysis, with dogwhistles at the furthest ends of extremity, then (just for fun) includes an option to match the map of left/right word frequencies to the closest color of noise. (because doesn't so much of political conversation we disagree with become just that...)

# "capitalist" vs. "free market", and other synonyms coded differently
it's not necessarily the case that a person using the term "capitalist" instead of "free market" would identify as relatively left-leaning -- for one, context can determine the applicability of synonyms in place of their counterparts. but it'd be interesting to see if it somehow patterned for context/environment: someone frequently in left-leaning spaces
